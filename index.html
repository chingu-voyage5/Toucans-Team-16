            <h3>Early life</h3>
            <p>Brendan Eich grew up in Palo Alto, and he attended Ellwood P. Cubberley High School, graduating in the class of 1979. Eich received his bachelor's degree in mathematics and computer science at Santa Clara University.
            He received his master's degree in 1985 from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
            Eich started his career at Silicon Graphics, working for seven years on operating system and network code.
            He then worked for three years at MicroUnity Systems Engineering writing microkernel and DSP code, and doing the first MIPS R4000 port of GCC.</p>

            <h3>Netscape and JavaScript</h3>
            <p>He started work at Netscape Communications Corporation in April 1995. Eich originally joined intending to put Scheme "in the browser", but his Netscape superiors insisted that the language resemble Java in terms of its syntax.
               The result was a language that had much of the functionality of Scheme, the object orientation of Self, and the syntax of Java. The first version was completed in ten days in order to accommodate the Navigator 2.0 Beta release schedule, and was called Mocha, but renamed LiveScript in September 1995 and later JavaScript in the same month.
               Eich continued to oversee the development of SpiderMonkey, the specific implementation of JavaScript in Navigator.</p>

            <h3>Mozilla</h3>
            <p>In early 1998, Eich co-founded the Mozilla project with Jamie Zawinski and others, creating the mozilla.org website, which was meant to manage open-source contributions to the Netscape source code. He served as Mozilla's chief architect. AOL bought Netscape in 1999. After AOL shut down the Netscape browser unit in July 2003, Eich helped spin out the Mozilla Foundation.
              In August 2005, after serving as Lead Technologist and as a member of the Board of Directors of the Mozilla Foundation, Eich became CTO of the newly founded Mozilla Corporation, meant to be the Mozilla Foundation's for-profit arm. Eich continued to "own" the Mozilla SpiderMonkey module, its JavaScript engine, until he passed on the ownership of it in 2011.
              On March 24, 2014, Eich was promoted to CEO of Mozilla Corporation. Gary Kovacs, John Lilly and Ellen Siminoff resigned from the Mozilla board prior to the appointment, some anonymously expressing disagreements with Eich's strategy and their desire for a CEO with experience in the mobile industry.</p>
